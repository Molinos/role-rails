# Role Rails [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/razum2um/role-rails.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/razum2um/role-rails)

Fork uses `data-role` instead of `role`.

Rails adapter for [Role.js](https://github.com/kossnocorp/role)

## Usage

### Basic usage

``` html
<div data-role="button"></div>
```

``` js
$('@button');
//=> <div data-role="button"></div>
```

For more information, read [role.js's README](https://github.com/kossnocorp/role/blob/master/README.md).

### Support for slim shortcuts

If you are using [slim](http://slim-lang.com/) or [skim](https://github.com/jfirebaugh/skim) role-rails will provide `@` shortcut for you.

It works like regular `#` (id) or `.` (class) shortcut.

For this example:

``` slim
@behaviour Trololo
```

... output will be like:

``` html
<div data-role="behaviour">Trololo</div>
```

You can also combine other shortcuts in any order you want:

``` slim
#some-id.class-name@role
```

## Installation

``` ruby
gem 'role-rails'
```

``` sh
$ bundle
```

For regular role.js version:

``` js
//= require jquery.role
```

For jQuery-free version (which patches `querySelector*`):

``` js
//= require role
```

## Roadmap

### 1.5.0

* Support for custom role attributes (like `@role-name` to `.js-role-name` or `data-role='role-name'`).

## Changelog

### 1.4.0

* Fix deprication warning caused by fresh [slim](http://slim-lang.com/) [#5](https://github.com/kossnocorp/role-rails/pull/5) [#6](https://github.com/kossnocorp/role-rails/pull/6),
* from this version `role-rails` version number no more reflect to role.js version (because it has independent features like support for slim's shortcuts).
